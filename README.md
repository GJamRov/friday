# Friday - General assistant Discord bot

Discord bot used in my servers for general commands. Written entirely from scratch as 
a means of practice in python and developing bots.

## Implemented Features
* Role assignment
* Voice activity announcement (when user joins or leaves a voice channel, a tts message is sent to a specified text channel)
* !roll command for rolling dices (usage: `!roll {number of dice} {number of sides of each dice})

## Planned Features
* Implementation of slash commands (high priority)
* votekick function (being debated)
* randomise teams function for splitting a group of users into a specified number of teams
* music streaming
